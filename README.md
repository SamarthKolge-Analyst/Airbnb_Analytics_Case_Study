## üåç About Airbnb

Airbnb is a global online marketplace that connects people looking for accommodations with homeowners willing to rent out their spaces. It has become one of the most popular platforms for short-term rentals, offering diverse lodging options worldwide.

## üìù Problem Statement

Over the past five years, Airbnb has observed a clear trend: listings with fewer or no images often remain unbooked, leading to a high number of redundant entries on the platform. To address this issue, it is crucial to determine the optimal number of images that maximize booking potential while minimizing the risk of unbooked listings.
